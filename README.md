# E-Qari

E-Qari is an application which assist illitrate/partially litrate muslims to learn Holy Quran recitation. It is built on top of React Native framework. Users can recite the Holy Quran with Translation (currently only urdu language), listen recitation in voice of world famous Qari and also improve their recitation by reciting in front of application and checking feedback within seconds. Our application sends user's voice to our server where audio is processed and feedback is sent to the user on application where user can see mistakes in red color and correct words in green color.

This project has been done as final year project for BS Computer Science course. We are group of young passionate developers and computer scienctists. We would love to carry this project to its new heights and this is only a first step towards e-learning of holy quran. Our goal is to make this application as much useful for each and every muslim around any corner of the world so that they can learn and recite the message of Allah(S.W.T) easily by use of their mobile phones.
